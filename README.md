Built a Covid-19 tracker in python, where data of total no. of cases, total no. of deaths, total no. of recovered cases of all the countries was scrapped and an API was generated.With the help of speech to text conversion library, the input was taken from the user in the form of Voice Note which was then converted into text format and by calling the API, generated during web scrapping; it threaded all the information from the website and provided the required output in the form of both speech and text.
